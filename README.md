# Reddit Data Analysis  
This repository contains code to analyze Reddit data related to cloud computing and cybersecurity. It pulls data from subreddits such as `computerscience`, `netsec`, `networking`, `sysadmin`, `programming`, and `cybersecurity` for keywords such as `cloudflare`, `fastly`, `edge computing`, `zscaler`, `cloudflare workers`, `cloudfront`, and `akamai`.  

The code is written in Python using the requests library and the csv library. The data is pulled from the Pushshift API.
